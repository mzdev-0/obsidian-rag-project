  Conceptual Plan: Migrating RAG Agent from ChromaDB to Qdrant

  1. Vision & Strategic Goal

  This initiative is an architectural evolution, not merely a database swap. We are migrating from ChromaDB to Qdrant to more effectively realize the
  project's core vision as outlined in the product-requirements.md. The primary goal is to leverage Qdrant's advanced filtering, payload indexing, and
  search capabilities to build a more precise, efficient, and powerful RAG micro-agent. This plan prioritizes achieving the project's target user queries
  over maintaining backward compatibility with the previous implementation.

  2. Phased Migration Strategy

  The migration is broken down into four conceptual phases, moving from foundational changes to application-level logic and final validation.

  Phase 1: Foundational Shift — Environment & Configuration

  The objective of this phase is to prepare the application's environment to support Qdrant's client-server architecture.

   * Dependency Transition: The project's dependencies must be updated to replace the ChromaDB driver with the necessary Qdrant clients. This involves
     introducing the official qdrant-client and the langchain-qdrant integration library, which will serve as the primary abstraction layer.
   * Configuration Modernization: The application's configuration model must be adapted to reflect a client-server database paradigm. This involves moving
     away from file-path-based configuration (db_path) and towards network-based connection parameters (e.g., QDRANT_URL, API keys). The configuration
     loading and validation logic must be updated to ensure the application can reliably connect to the Qdrant service upon startup.

  Phase 2: Re-architecting Data Handling — Ingestion & Storage

  This phase focuses on redesigning the data ingestion pipeline to align with Qdrant's more structured and performant storage architecture.

   * Establish a Robust Indexing Strategy: The core of this phase is to define and implement a payload indexing strategy within Qdrant. Unlike the previous
     implementation, we will explicitly create indexes on all key metadata fields (title, created_date, tags, etc.). This is a fundamental shift to leverage
     Qdrant's strength in pre-filtered queries, which is critical for performance.
   * Refine the Data Processing Pipeline: The existing pipeline (Note -> ContentSection -> Document) will be maintained, but the final Document object's
     metadata must be perfectly aligned with the newly defined Qdrant payload schema. This ensures that when documents are ingested, their metadata is
     immediately indexed and available for high-performance filtering.

  Phase 3: Enhancing Retrieval Intelligence — The Query Engine

  This is the most critical phase, where we overhaul the application's retrieval logic to fully exploit Qdrant's advanced capabilities.

   * Evolve the Query Planner: The LLM-based Query Planner must be "taught" to think in terms of Qdrant. The prompt that guides the planner will be revised
     to reflect Qdrant's more expressive filtering syntax and capabilities. The goal is to empower the planner to generate more sophisticated and efficient
     query plans that go beyond the limitations of the previous system.
   * Delegate Complexity to the Database Engine: The retriever logic will be fundamentally re-architected to delegate complex operations to Qdrant, resulting
     in cleaner application code and better performance. This involves two key conceptual upgrades:
       1. Implement True Hybrid Search: The current multi-step process of "search then filter" will be replaced by a single, atomic query to Qdrant. The
          retriever will be modified to pass both the semantic vector and the metadata filters in a single API call, allowing the database to perform a
          pre-filtered vector search. This is a significant performance and efficiency win.
       2. Leverage Native Deduplication: The current Python-based, post-retrieval deduplication logic is inefficient and will be entirely removed. It will be
          replaced by utilizing Qdrant's native group_by functionality during the search itself. This will ensure that for any given query, we receive only
          the most relevant result per source document, directly from the database.

  Phase 4: Validation & Verification

  This phase ensures the migration was successful and that the application is now more capable than before.

   * Develop a Comprehensive Testing Strategy: The existing test suite will be adapted. Unit tests will be updated to mock the new QdrantVectorManager
     interface. More importantly, new integration tests will be created to validate the enhanced functionality. These tests will specifically target the
     success of true hybrid search and native, grouped deduplication.
   * Align with Project Goals: The ultimate measure of success is whether the new implementation better serves the "Target User Queries" outlined in the
     product-requirements.md. The final validation step will be to execute these complex queries (e.g., compound temporal and topical searches) and confirm
     that the Qdrant-powered agent returns more accurate, non-redundant, and efficiently retrieved results.

  Definition of Success

  The migration will be considered complete when the RAG micro-agent is fully functional with a Qdrant backend and demonstrably better at handling the
  complex, multi-faceted queries that define the project's core purpose.
