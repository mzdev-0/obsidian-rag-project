## RAG Micro-Agent: Development Roadmap - REVISED FOR REALITY

**Updated to reflect actual implementation vs aspirational goals.**

This roadmap tracks what is actually working vs what remains to be implemented.
- ‚úÖ = Actually implemented and working
- üü° = Partially implemented, needs real data
- ‚ùå = Not started or broken

## Blockers Identified:
1. **Broken integration testing** - test_agent.py references deleted agent.py
2. **No embedding generation** - Collections exist but aren't populated
3. **No note ingestion pipeline** - Can't turn real notes into searchable embeddings

---

### **Milestone 1: Building the Core Retrieval Pipeline - COMPLETED ‚úÖ**

**Goal**: To create a functional, end-to-end pipeline that can execute a query plan and retrieve deduplicated content.

*   **Feature 1: Query Planner Engine** ‚úÖ DONE
    *   Implemented `deconstruct_query` with JSON schema validation
    *   Robust JSON parsing with manual fallback
    *   Uses configurable LLM endpoints via environment variables

*   **Feature 2: Hybrid Search & Deduplication** ‚úÖ DONE
    *   Implemented `retrieve_context` using LangChain Chroma vectorstore
    *   Dynamic Qdrant filter generation working
    *   File-based deduplication (`_deduplicate_query_sections`) implemented
    *   Dual-path: semantic vs metadata queries supported

*   **Definition of Done**: ‚úÖ ACHIEVED

---

### **Milestone 2: Implementing Adaptive Intelligence - NEARLY COMPLETE**

**Goal**: Smart decision-making with live query planner and dual-response formatting.

*   **Feature 1: Intelligent Response Formatting** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
    *   `_package_metadata_only` and `_package_selective_context` implemented
    *   `retrieve_context` uses protocol based on query planner decisions

*   **Feature 2: Activating the Live Planner** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
    *   Implemented via `main.py` `RAGMicroAgent` class (not deleted agent.py)
    *   Full orchestration: `query()` ‚Üí `deconstruct_query()` ‚Üí `retrieve_context()`
    *   Smart response format selection working

*   **Definition of Done**: üü° PARTIALLY ACHIEVED
    - Full pipeline exists but requires populated ChromaDB to work with real data
    - Missing embedding generation from actual note vault

---

### **Milestone 3: Hardening and Validation - IN PROGRESS üîÑ**

**Goal**: Production-ready tool with comprehensive testing.

*   **Feature 1: Unit Test Coverage** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
    *   Critical helper functions tested (_build_where_filter, deduplication, JSON parsing)
    *   Query planner integration tests passing
    *   Note parsing and metadata extraction tested
    *   **Status**: 24/24 unit tests passing

*   **Feature 2: End-to-End Integration Testing** ‚ùå INCOMPLETE
    *   **test_agent.py broken**: Still references deleted `agent.py` 
    *   **Missing collection population**: Tests create temp DBs but can't populate from real data
    *   **Need to refactor**: Update integration tests to use `main.RAGMicroAgent`
    *   **Need to implement**: Actual note ingestion and embedding generation

*   **Definition of Done**: üü° BLOCKED
    - Unit tests complete
    - Integration testing requires fixing test infrastructure
    - Note ingestion pipeline needed for real-world validation
